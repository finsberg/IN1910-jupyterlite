# IN1910 - jupyterlite version

This is a helper repo for generating a [`jupyterlite`](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) powered webpage from a jupyter-book.
Basic idea: clone the relevant repository. Convert all markdown files to jupyter notebooks and build the site with `jupyterlite`.

Site is hosted at https://finsberg.github.io/IN1910-jupyterlite
